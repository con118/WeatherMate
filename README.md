# Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard challenge is a web application that allows users to search for weather information for multiple cities. The application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API and presents the information in a user-friendly interface that includes current weather conditions, a five-day forecast, and a search history. The application uses localStorage to store persistent data, such as the user's search history. The challenge requires the application to meet specific acceptance criteria, including the use of the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, intuitive and easy-to-navigate user experience, and adherence to best practices for file structure, naming conventions, indentation, comments, and commit messages. The project will be graded on technical acceptance criteria, deployment, application quality, and repository quality.

## How It Works

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that retrieves weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeather API. It presents the data in an easy-to-use interface that includes current weather conditions and a five-day forecast. The application also uses localStorage to store the user's search history. The project is graded on technical acceptance criteria, deployment, application quality, and repository quality, and it is expected to have a user-friendly interface and adhere to best practices for coding and organization.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
